## About Me

I'm a Computer Scientist with a passion for web development and creating immersive digital experiences. This portfolio showcases the interactive projects I've built using modern web technologies. Dive into my site and explore how I've used React, Vite, Three.js, and TailwindCSS to bring dynamic visuals and smooth performance to life!

---

## Technologies & Tools

- **React** for building user interfaces  
- **Vite** for fast and efficient development  
- **Three.js** for 3D graphics, GPU access and physics base simulation using shaders! 
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling (and because writing a whole other CSS file is annoying!)
